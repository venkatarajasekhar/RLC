Algorithms implementation (SOTA, Prog_RLC and Appro_RLC) and databases used in our paper "RLC: Ranking Lag Correlations with Flexible Sliding Windows in Data Streams". 

The three algorithms are implemented in BruteForce.cpp. All the databases are stored in the folder "database". And synthetic datasets are generated by DataGenerator.cpp.

See the detailed in our paper:
